<h1>PigeonScript: The Future of Avian Coding</h1>

<p>Welcome to the official website for PigeonScript, the revolutionary programming language designed with pigeons in mind!</p>

<p>PigeonScript breaks the mold of traditional languages, offering an intuitive and avian-inspired syntax that makes coding accessible to feathered friends of all levels.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Coo-ious Syntax:</b> PigeonScript replaces dry keywords with familiar cooing sounds, making coding a natural extension of a pigeon's vocal repertoire.</li>
  <li><b>Flock-Based Logic:</b> Control flow statements are inspired by flocking behavior, allowing pigeons to write elegant code that leverages their collective intelligence.</li>
  <li><b>Crumb-Sized Data:</b> Data types are designed to reflect the importance of crumbs in a pigeon's life, making data management a breeze.</li>
  <li><b>Built-in Breadcrumb Navigation:</b> Effortlessly navigate through code with intuitive breadcrumb trails, mimicking a pigeon's natural foraging patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started (Soon!)</h2>

<p>PigeonScript is still under development, but we are working hard to bring you the tools and resources you need to start coding in PigeonScript.</p>

<h2>Join the Flock</h2>

<p>We are actively seeking feedback from the pigeon developer community. Share your thoughts, coo-ment your code, and help us shape the future of PigeonScript!</p>
